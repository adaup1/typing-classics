  "Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking d",
  "id I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood.",

  "one too many by my weary self, Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn’d who gladly fl",

  "hould in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steal",
  "s home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair dayli",

  "ood counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? MONTAGUE. I neith",
  "er know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO. Have you importun’d him by any means? MONTAGUE. Both by m",
  "yself and many other friends; But he, his own affections’ counsellor, Is to himself—I will not say h",
  "ow true— But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bi",
  "t with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the ",
  "sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter",
  " Romeo. BENVOLIO. See, where he comes. So please you step aside; I’ll know his grievance or be much ",

  "OMEO. Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO. At thy good heart’s oppression. ROMEO. Why such is love’s trans",
  "gression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With",
  " more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is ",
  "a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vex’d, a ",
  "sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears: What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a pr",
  "eserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. [_Going._] BENVOLIO. Soft! I will go along: And if you leave me so",
  ", you do me wrong. ROMEO. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here. This is not Romeo, he’s some other",
  " where. BENVOLIO. Tell me in sadness who is that you love? ROMEO. What, shall I groan and tell thee?",
  " BENVOLIO. Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who. ROMEO. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will, A ",

  "ies, with beauty dies her store. BENVOLIO. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROME",
  "O. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; For beauty starv’d with her severity, Cuts beauty",
  " off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me des",

  " with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO. When the devout rel",

  "Enter Juliet. JULIET. How now, who calls? NURSE. Your mother. JULIET. Madam, I am here. What is your",
  " will? LADY CAPULET. This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, co",

  "ay fourteen of my teeth, And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, She is not fourteen. How",
  " long is it now To Lammas-tide? LADY CAPULET. A fortnight and odd days. NURSE. Even or odd, of all d",
  "ays in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she,—God rest all Christi",
  "an souls!— Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. But as I said, On Lamma",
  "s Eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. ’Tis since the eart",
  "hquake now eleven years; And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—, Of all the days of the year, ",
  "upon that day: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall; ",
  "My lord and you were then at Mantua: Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said, When it did taste the wo",
  "rmwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy, and fall out with ",
  "the dug! Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge. And since that time it",
  " is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood She could have run and waddled all",
  " about; For even the day before she broke her brow, And then my husband,—God be with his soul! A was",
  " a merry man,—took up the child: ‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall back",
  "ward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left cryi",
  "ng, and said ‘Ay’. To see now how a jest shall come about. I warrant, and I should live a thousand y",
  "ears, I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and s",
  "aid ‘Ay.’ LADY CAPULET. Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace. NURSE. Yes, madam, yet I cannot ",
  "choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’; And yet I warrant it had upon it br",
  "ow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone; A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly. ‘Yea,’ quoth ",
  "my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; Wilt thou not, ",

  "ten in the margent of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, onl",
  "y lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride For fair without the fair within to ",

  "So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. NURSE. No less,",

  " must be shall be. FRIAR LAWRENCE. That’s a certain text. PARIS. Come you to make confession to this",
  " father? JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you. PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me",
  ". JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. JUL",
  "IET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS. Po",

  "T. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS. Thy fa",

  "_Exit._] JULIET. O shut the door, and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cur",

  "my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. ",
  "JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If ",
  "in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’l",

  "Romeo’s seal’d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to",
  " another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time, Give me some prese",

  "lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O’er-co",

  "To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from",
  " this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my",

  " John, Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight Return’d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefix",

  " cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awak",
  "ing, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come fort",
  "h And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, ",
  "too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and",
  " to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be",
  " sacrific’d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. PRINCE. We still have known",

  " I departed not, and left him there. PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the Cou",
