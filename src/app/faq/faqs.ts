    question:
      "What makes Typig Classics different from other typing tests/games?",
    answer:
      "While most typing tests provide small amounts of text (often random words or phrases), Typing Classics provides the opportunity to type along to classic books in their entirety.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request a book to be added?",
    answer:
      "A feature to request books is currently in progress. Check back soon!",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I save my progress?",
    answer:
      "Users will soon be able to create accounts to save progress. Thank you for your patience!",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are there spelling/grammatical errors in the books?",
    answer:
      "Currently all books on Typing Classics come from the public domain. Some of these texts are centuries old. As such, they may contain spelling and grammatical errors. Some modern reproductions of these texts have these errors corrected, but may not be in the public domain.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pick which chapter I want to type?",
    answer:
      "No. Texts must be typed in the order they appear in the book. Typing Classics is focussed on being an endourance test rather than a traditional way to read books. In order to provide the most accurate stats possible, and preserve the purpose of the game, books must be typed from start to finish.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why are file names such as '.jpeg' scattered through the text of the books?",
    answer:
      "Some books contain images which cannot be traditionally typed. These file names are left for reference.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Some texts have special characters not found on a QWERTY keyboard. How do I type them?",
    answer:
      "In the typing view, toggle 'Easy Special Characters'. When 'Easy Special Characters' is on, special characters are mapped tostandard English characters. To see which characters are mapped, hover over the help icon in the 'Easy Special Characters' container.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I type books in a language other than English?",
    answer:
      "At this time only English books are supported. Automatically translating the page will break the typing test.",
  },
  {
    question: "I got pulled away from my keyboard. Will this impact my score",
    answer:
      "The timer automatically pauses after 2 seconds of inactivity. It is unlikely to make a major impact on your score given the size of the prompts.",
  },
